# SOLID design principles
## Single Responsibility Principle.
Each software module should only have one reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle.
Your classes should be open for extension but closed to modifications.

## Liskov Substitution Principle.
Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle.
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle.
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
